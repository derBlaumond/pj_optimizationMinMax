# Remark:
# Overall, this is a solid submission without major issues. Well done! 
# Positives:
# + Overall good tests
# + Overall good code style and readability
# + Overall solid documentation
# + Alpha-beta pruning correctly implemented
# + Reasonable heuristic
# Weaknesses:
# - Mistakes in minimax implementation, poor play as a result
# - Naming of variables and functions can be better
# - Tests in test_minimax.py don't work because the names of the functions don't exist in minimax.py
# - Too many comments
# - Non-standard docstring format?
# - Some refactoring steps could be done to make the code more readable
